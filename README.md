# DecompositionofdatasetinR

**The code begins by loading necessary libraries, particularly the 'fpp' and 'fpp2' libraries for business forecasting. The Boston dataset is also loaded for further analysis.**

**The dataset's properties are explored to better understand its structure. This includes checking its dimensions (number of rows and columns), extracting the column names (which are "nyase" and "bse"), and determining the class of the dataset, which helps identify it as a time series.**

**The code identifies the dataset's seasonality, revealing that it follows a 12-month cycle, which is common for many time series datasets. This information is crucial for time series analysis and forecasting.**

**Seasonal decomposition is performed using STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess). This method helps break down the time series data into its individual components: seasonality, trend, and remainder (or residuals). The decomposition provides valuable insights into the underlying patterns in the data.**

**After performing the decomposition, the code extracts the seasonally adjusted data, which represents the time series with the seasonal component removed. This adjusted data is then overlaid with the original time series to visualize the impact of the seasonal component on the data.**

**The code proceeds to generate forecasts for the time series data. It uses an alternative method to decompose the time series data with the 'decompose' function. This provides an alternative view of the time series decomposition.**

**Finally, the code extracts the seasonally adjusted data using 'decompose' and overlays it with the original data. This step allows for a comparison of the decomposition results between STL and 'decompose' methods.**

**In summary, the code loads libraries, explores the dataset, identifies seasonality, performs seasonal decomposition using STL, extracts seasonally adjusted data, generates forecasts, and provides an alternative decomposition method for comparison. The code is a fundamental step in time series analysis, offering insights into the seasonality and trend components, which are crucial for forecasting in business contexts.**
